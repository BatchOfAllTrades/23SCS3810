Events (code*: string, title: string, season: string, year: int, venue_id: int)

Bonus:
1. Events' := Equijoin Events E and EventDays ED
                    E.code = ED.event_code and
                    ED.date = '02/20/23' and
                    E.title = 'The Entity Sets Ballet'
2. Equijoin SectorPrices SP and Events' E'
                    SP.event_date = E'.date and
                    SP.event_time = E'.time
